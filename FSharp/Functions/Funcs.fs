// We use "let" to define functions, too.

// The parameters to the function follow its name, with no commas.
// The = sign starts the function body.
// There is no "return" in F#; the last expression in the function body is the return value.
// Jump to "main" below to see how to call this function.

// Note we did not define a type for x... so what type is it, and how is that determined?

// If the context of the function makes it clear, F# can infer the type of each parameter.
// In this case, F# defaults to "int" for x, because we perform x * x in the body.

// If the context is unclear, then other hints may be needed.

// Like variables, "square" has a type. Its type is "int -> int", which indicates a function
// taking an int variable and returning an int.

// What types are the three parameters? Infer it based on the body of the function.


// The type of "interest" is float -> float -> int -> float; a function taking a float, float,
// and int; and returning float.
