// Tuples are fixed-length, ordered collections of heterogenous data.
// Tuples are constructed with parentheses.

let dinner = ("green eggs", "ham") // commas separate tuples, semicolons separate lists
// The type of dinner is "string * string", indicating a tuple of two string values.

// Tuples can contain any data type, including other tuples.
let nested = (1, (2.0, [3; 4; 5]), (4L, "5", '6'))
// What type is nested?

// If a tuple is a pair, then you can use the functions "fst" and "snd" to retrieve 
// the first and second elements, but ONLY FOR PAIRS.
let meal1 = fst dinner
let meal2 = snd dinner

// let nestedPair = snd nested // ERROR: nested has length 3, not 2.

// So how to access the elements of a longer tuple?

// This is called "unpacking". The parentheses are optional. The underscore means "don't care."
//need that fourth one because the unpacking requires tuple sizes need to be the same

// Tuples are useful for gluing together values when you don't want to have to create a new
// datatype. They have good performance in F#, but they aren't a replacement for classes.

// Tuples can be passed as parameters to functions. This should not be a shock.

                                      // in Java, C++, etc. The parentheses here create a single
                                      // tuple value, and the function takes only one parameter.


// Unpacking can be done directly in the parameter list.
let betterAddOne (x, y, z) = // a single parameter of type int * int * int
    (x+1, y+1, z+1)
    

// So what can we use tuples for, really?
// 1. To return multiple values from a function, as long as those values aren't better represented
//    by a new proper type.

// Attempt to parse a string as an integer. Return a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the
// parse succeeded, and the parsed integer if the parse succeeded, otherwise 0.
